# Readme

Hello dear programmer

If you have looked at the codes already, you might have said a lot of wtfs.

I have used to many bad things during the writing of this projects, including a lot of global states, 
mutating things that should have been readonly and constant, some circular dependancies, etc. Also my code
lacks DI and some other useful patterns.

I accept that the blames on me, but this was due to the deadline and my lack of time (also it is too easy to write
bad codes in C#).

Forgive the code.

Best regards, the project creator.
